# About

This is a repo for following a tutorial on [Strapi's Blog](https://strapi.io/blog/form-validation-in-typescipt-projects-using-zod-and-react-hook-forma). I was able to follow this tutorial _mostly_ to the letter. The only exception was that I needed to uninstall and re-install `react` and `react-dom` because the versions that came down with the template from the original author relied on release candidates (very bleeding edge ðŸ”ªðŸ©¸) and conflicted with [@hookforms/resolves](https://github.com/react-hook-form/resolvers) which was happy to take the the latest
versions of the libraries ðŸ‘‰ "react": "^18.3.1", "react-dom": "^18.3.1".

## The standard README.md that comes from create-next-app
</summary>

    This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

    ## Getting Started

    First, run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

    You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

    [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

    The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

    This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

    ## Deploy on Vercel

    The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
